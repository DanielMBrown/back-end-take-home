# Running/Launching instructions

**I recommend you run the project with Docker**

## Running from Visual Studio

* Open the project in Visual Studio

#### With Docker
* Set the docker-compose project as the startup project (Right Click -> Set as Startup Project)
* Press Start, or F5
* Your default browser should automatically open to the swagger page. If not, navigate to http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html

#### Without Docker
* Change the `Copy To Output Directory` setting for all files in `data/full/` to `Copy always`
* If it isn't already, set the FlightInformationService project as the startup project (Right Click -> Set as Startup Project)
* Press Start, or F5
* Your default browser should automatically open to the swagger page. If not, navigate to http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html

## Running from Command Line
*Please note, the docker file being used is autogenerated and is not necessarily representative of what a real docker file should look like*

* Run this command from the project repository: `docker build -t guestlogix-backend-test -f FlightInformationService/Dockerfile .`
* After the image is built, run `docker run -d -p 5000:80 guestlogix-backend-test`
* Navigate to http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html in your browser
